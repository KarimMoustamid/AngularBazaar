# E-Commerce App Project Overview

This project is a proof of concept for an e-commerce application developed using Angular, .Net Core, and integrating the Stripe payment processing service. Below are the key features and technologies used in this project:

## Technologies Used
- **.Net Core**: Backend development platform for implementing server-side logic.
- **Angular**: Frontend development framework for building the user interface.
- **C# Generics**: Used for creating reusable components and classes.
- **Repository and Unit of Work Pattern**: Design patterns for data access and management.
- **Specification Pattern**: Pattern for creating complex queries and filters in the application.
- **Caching**: Used for optimizing application performance by storing frequently accessed data.
- **Angular Lazy Loading**: Technique for loading modules/components only when needed, improving application load time.
- **Angular Routing**: Handling navigation and rendering different components based on the URL.
- **Angular Reactive Forms**: Building dynamic and interactive forms in Angular.
- **Angular Creating a MultiStep Form Wizard**: Implementing a wizard-like interface for forms that span multiple steps.
- **Accepting payments using Stripe**: Integrating the Stripe API for processing online payments securely.
- **Angular Re-usable form components**: Creating reusable form components to improve code reusability.
- **Angular validation and async validation**: Implementing form validation logic and handling asynchronous validation tasks.

This e-commerce app demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies, design patterns, and best practices for building a scalable and efficient online store application.
